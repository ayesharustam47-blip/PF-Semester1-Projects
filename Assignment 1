//program no.2:Write a function which reverses the element of an array so that the last element becomes  first, the second from the last become second and so forth. 
The function is to reverse the  elements in place-that is. Without using another array.

//program no.3:Write a function that creates two dimensional matrix representing the pascal triangle. In pascal triangle each element is the sum of the element directly above 
it and the element to the left  of the element directly above it (if any). A pascal triangle of size 7 is shown below. 
1 
1 1 
1 2 1 
1 3 3 1 
1 4 6 4 1 
1 5 10 10 5 1  
1 6 15 20 15 6 1  
In the above example, element [0][0] is set to 1. Then element [0][1] is set to the sum of element  [0][-1] + element [0][0] since there is no of index for -1, your program must recognize that you  
are in column 0 and simplu bring down the number above the current element. The element  [1][1] then becomes the sum of element [0][0]+ element [0][1].

//Program no.4:Write a program that creates an array of 150 random integers in the range 1 to 200 and  then, using the sequential search, searches the array 200 times using randomly generated targets  
in the same range.at the end of program, display the following statistics: 
a. The number searches completed. 
b. The number of successful searches. 
c. The percentage of successful searches. 
d. The average number of tests per search. 
To determine the average tests per search, you must count the number of loops for each search  target .each successful search will loop between 1 and 150 times; each successful search will  
loop exactly 150 times. The average is the sum of all the loop counts divided by the number of  searches (200).
